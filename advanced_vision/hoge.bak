We propose recovery method from the failure of a LiDAR-based mobile robot
self-localization using Visual Positioning System (VPS).
We have proposed a recovery method using GNSS. This method makes
a robot wander so as to search a place where GNSS signals
are accurate. In this paper, we use the VPS based recovery method
with the previous method so as to enhance the chance of recovery,
and reduce the fequency of wandering. 
The experimental results showed that the VPS based method is
effective in an actual enviroment with some tall buildings.
